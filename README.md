# Ramses-Fusion

**Ramses-Fusion** is the official bridge between the [Ramses](https://ramses.rxlab.guide/) pipeline ecosystem and Blackmagic Fusion. Developed by [**Overmind Studios**](https://www.overmind-studios.de), it transforms Fusion into a pipeline-aware environment, allowing compositors to focus on their creative work while the technical organization is handled automatically.

## 🌟 Overview

In modern production, staying organized across hundreds of shots and assets is a major challenge. Ramses-Fusion solves this by integrating the production database directly into the Fusion interface. It ensures that every composition follows project standards, every version is tracked, and every render goes exactly where it needs to be.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 🔗 Pipeline Connectivity
Stop digging through folders. Ramses-Fusion allows you to browse your entire project, jump between shots, and initialize new compositions from standardized templates instantly.

### 📐 Intelligent Scene Setup
One click aligns your composition with the project's technical specifications. Resolution, frame ranges, framerates, and aspect ratios are pulled directly from the Ramses database, eliminating manual setup errors.

### 📦 Smart Asset Management
Bring the rest of the pipeline into your Flow. Easily import published renders, assets, or cameras from other departments, and swap versions with a single click while maintaining your node connections.

### 🏁 Managed Iteration & Publishing
Handle the entire lifecycle of a shot from WIP to Final. The tool manages incremental versioning, metadata tagging, and automated master renders, ensuring your exports are always standardized and ready for review.
